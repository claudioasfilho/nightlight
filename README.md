# nightlight
We decided to take a couple of days off and relax on a cabin in the middle of nowhere.

A little while before putting Victor to bed we realized we forgot to bring his nightlight, which tells him if he should stay in bed, the light is Red, or if it is time to wake-up, the light turns Green.

Being an FAE I always carry my boards with me and realized I got my Thunderboard Sense 2 board, which has a few RGB leds.

Some minutes later I put together few lines of code making the board do exactly what his nightlight does and used a semi-translucent food container as the Light cover.

Bottom line you can leave your Engineering life for a bit but the Engineer does not leave you ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
